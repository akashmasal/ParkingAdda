This measure will assist the government in overcoming the country&#39;s traffic and space congestion issues, particularly in cities.</p>\r\n\r\n<p> </p>\r\n\r\n<p>Consider all of the unnecessary gas, petroleum, oil, etc. that these automobiles consume on their 10-15 minute long hunt for parking — every single day. It is well known that automobiles release more toxic emissions when their engines are turned on when stalled in traffic than when they are travelling at greater speeds. It&#39;s no wonder, therefore, that India&#39;s air pollution levels have been steadily growing.</p>\r\n\r\n<p> </p>\r\n\r\n<p>For a long time, India&#39;s major cities - Delhi, Mumbai, Bangalore, and others – have struggled with the issue of parking space. Did you know that a scarcity of parking places is the single cause of 30% of traffic congestion in this region? As customers&#39; buying power grows and more automobiles on the road, these issues will become more prevalent.</p>\r\n\r\n<p> </p>\r\n\r\n<p>Global carbon dioxide emissions have grown by more than 50% since 1990, according to reports published in The Millennium Development Goals 2015. It may have seemed far-fetched 20 years ago, but it is now apparent that the air we breathe affects our lifespan. Although air pollution does not kill you, it does harm the health of around 200,000 individuals.</p>\r\n\r\n<p> </p>\r\n\r\n<p>Furthermore, the lack of parking generates traffic congestion on the roadways, which adds to the overall impact. According to researchers, 30 percent of total CO2 emissions are produced by traffic congestion caused by individuals looking for parking. This emphasizes the pressing necessity to examine these figures. According to estimates, if Smart Parking facilities are implemented, carbon emissions will be reduced by 15-20% on average.</p>\r\n\r\n<p> </p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Using technology to solve the parking problem</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Modern issues necessitate modern answers. As Indian cities lead the world in terms of the number of automobiles on the road, we must look to technology to ensure that this growing number of cars does not contribute to more stress and pollution. Here is where smart parking solutions come into play. Smart parking systems collect data in real time and provide motorists with a better understanding of the amount of parking spaces available around them.</p>\r\n\r\n<p> </p>\r\n\r\n<p>Aside from pollution reduction, there are further advantages for motorists.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>According to an IBM survey done in Delhi and Bangalore in 2011, 58 percent of individuals who drive vehicles are the most stressed persons in the world. Parking troubles are most likely a big source of stress. When individuals cannot locate approved parking places, they frequently park their automobiles on the side of the road, especially if they are on a tight schedule. This creates a new issue since they are always concerned about their automobile being towed, discovered, or, in the worst-case scenario, stolen. According to reports, the world&#39;s urban population is growing, and by 2050, 68 percent of the world&#39;s population will be living in cities.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>ParkingAdda, like numerous other emerging mobility firms, is assisting cities in implementing Smart Online Parking technology to reap the benefits of efficient transportation, such as less traffic and pollution, more dynamic local economies, and improved citizen quality of life. Exhaust emissions are dangerous to one&#39;s health, and Indian cities consistently rank among the most polluted.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Smart Parking is the way of the future for emerging countries like India to structure and manage their unstructured parking systems. Streamlined parking has a number of advantages.</p>\r\n\r\n<ul>\r\n <li>Parking optimization: Users may use the app to discover the best available parking spot, saving them time, effort, and money. The parking lot soon fills up, and businesses and commercial organizations may take use of the available space. Unauthorized parking and on-street parking can both be curtailed.</li>\r\n <li>Improved Traffic Flow: As fewer cars are required to go about seeking for an open parking place, traffic flow improves.</li>\r\n <li>Pollution reduction: Looking for a parking spot uses much too much automobile oil, gasoline, diesel, CNG, and other fuels in a single day. An ideal parking solution will greatly reduce travel time while also reducing the amount of daily car emissions and, as a result, India&#39;s and the world&#39;s pollution levels.</li>\r\n <li>Improved Car Security: Our spot representative and vehicle have real-time parking lot data, which may help avoid suspicious behavior and parking violations. Furthermore, if there was less spot-searching traffic on the roads, accidents caused by the obstruction of hunting for parking may be reduced.</li>\r\n <li>Safety and Security of the Space: Users can only utilize our parking places for registered cars, and our spot representative will be on hand to recognize any suspicious conduct or parking offences.</li>\r\n <li>Real-time data and trend insight: Over time, a digital parking system may collect data that indicates patterns and linkages between parking lots and users. These trends might be quite useful to parking lot owners when it comes to determining how to respond to vehicles. Booking confirmation, start time reminder, end time reminder, payment notice, and so on are all sent in real time, especially when dealing with ‘ParkingAdda&#39;.</li>\r\n <li>New Revenue Streams include: Individuals, organizations, and other institutions can generate a passive income by renting out their premises.</li>\r\n <li>Easy Integrated Payments: The &#39;ParkingAdda&#39; application collects and distributes invoicing and payments.

This means that maintaining a car in Mumbai is roughly 20 times more expensive\\difficult than one in New York.</p>\r\n\r\n<p> </p>\r\n\r\n<p>Indian metropolises are facing a mobility dilemma as a result of fast economic and demographic expansion. Today&#39;s cities experience enormous strain or pressure on parking spots, resulting in challenges such as traffic congestion, unequal demand and supply, and environmental dangers, to mention a few. India suffers from chaotic conditions such as packed pathways, illegal parking, two – side parking, and criminal activities owing to inadequate monitoring as a result of bad parking management and legislation.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Let&#39;s take a look at some of the most critical parking challenges surrounding Indian cities today.</p>\r\n\r\n<p> </p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Overcrowded Parking lots</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>One of the most prevalent issues nowadays is a lack of parking places. Vehicles continue to outnumber available parking places, choking streets. Incidences of violence owing to overcrowding, distorted automobiles due to a lack of space, and overcharging for parking are some of the problems that arise as a consequence. To address the issue, most localities suggest adding parking spots. Despite limited land space and resources, parks and abandoned plots are being exploited as possible parking spots, and multi-level facilities are being created.</p>\r\n\r\n<p> </p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Tariffs that are unregulated</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Parking spots are in short supply due to an uncontrolled price system. Parking in Indian metropolises is either free or modestly charged, with costs remaining uncontrolled for many years. For example, Mumbai charges the same parking cost that it did years ago and has one of the world&#39;s lowest fares. Because parking prices cease to rise after a set amount of time, the longer a person remains in a parking place, the less they must pay. For Example:  Parking is at Rs. 20 per hour in Sarojini Nagar, Delhi, with a typical cost of Rs. 100 for 24 hours (Figures taken are approx.), making parking much more affordable.</p>\r\n\r\n<p> </p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>On-Street Parking vs. Off-Street Parking</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Another issue in Indian cities is the lopsided demand for on-street parking, which is less expensive than off-street parking. On-street parking difficulties can create delays, especially on busy roadways. Tariff balance is required for both types of areas to be properly utilized. For example, San Francisco has tried and adjusted hourly fees according to the demand and provided off-peak discounts to reduce congestion around garages during rush hour. ParkingAdda has developed their very own Made in India technology, to simply and increase authorized parking options. They provide easy online parking options along with better vehicle safety provisions.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>                                                                              </p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Cruising</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Another issue that emerges as a result of a scarcity of parking places in Indian cities is cruising, which involves automobiles hunting for a parking spot, resulting in long lines, congestion, and pollution. When there is no free on-street parking, most cars opt to cruise rather than pay for parking. Indian metros offer an economic incentive to cruise by underpricing on-street parking. Once occupied, low-cost parking is not abandoned for hours, and cases of automobiles being left for days have been documented. Booking online through apps like ‘ParkingAdda’ reduces cruising to around 90 % as they offer booking spots up to 36 hours in advance, MAP guide to the exact spot as well as they have a verifier or representative at every spot who you can call for any further assistance.</p>\r\n\r\n<p> </p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Parking in residential neighborhoods</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Parking spots are nearly often built into residential units in Indian metros since it is believed that designs without them will not attract purchasers. This raises the entire cost of development, which is exacerbated when parking spots are left empty. Because parking construction costs the same whether the structure is a luxury high-rise or a basic apartment complex, lower-income inhabitants, who are less likely to own automobiles, end up bearing the burden of parking expenditures, effectively subsidizing parking for others. Any such burdens of can be rented out to Parking Adda, who will turn these expenditures into huge incomes for the buildings or societies. Residents are frequently subjected to spillover parking as a result of commercial visits and excessive car traffic.</p>\r\n\r\n<p> </p>\r\n\r\n<p>Solution to Park like A Boss</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Solving traffic problems with smart parking is the way forward, which is why parking adda is a need-based service in the country that looks at organising parking choices. </p>\r\n\r\n<p>We also attempt to make use of any available area that may be used efficiently through our&#39;rent your place&#39; and earn option. </p>\r\n\r\n<p>In order to provide a complete parking solution, we have created our own patented technology and produced our own equipment. If there are any problems that arise they can be resolve it in no time.</p>\r\n\r\n<p> </p>\r\n\r\n<p>ParkingAdda, in short, operates all of its technological operations and production processes in-house.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Vehicle owners will naturally reduce their use of illegal parking spots if they have access to better and safer parking facilities.

But why should politicians worry about Smart Parking, and why should they act now? It&#39;s because time isn&#39;t on our side. Allow us to clarify.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Within the passenger vehicle category, automobile sales increased to 1.21 lakh currently from 55,497 units, in June 2020. According to a Goldman Sachs study, India will become the world&#39;s third-largest auto market with 7.4 million cars.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Globally, by the end of 2016, the worldwide vehicle population was at 1.32 billion vehicles and trucks, according to Wards Intelligence. This figure is more than double what it was 20 years ago. Furthermore, car manufacturing and sales show no indications of slowing down. It is anticipated that by 2035, there will be almost 2 billion automobiles on the road, and others believe it may be even sooner. With such a rapid increase in car numbers yet such a restricted supply of space, the parking environment must adapt.</p>\r\n\r\n<p> </p>\r\n\r\n<p>Below, we&#39;ll go over some of the key advantages that a smart parking system offers drivers. We&#39;ll discuss the benefits for cities in a subsequent piece.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Real Time Update-</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>A driver will receive Real-Time Updates of spot availability and bookings. He’ll receive reminders 15 Mins before parking time starts (in case of pre booked parking) and also 15 before the end time, giving an option to extent parking time via the app.</p>\r\n\r\n<p> </p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>There is less fuel waste- </strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Drivers are guided to an open parking space which can be pre-booked, through a map guide. As a result, they waste less kilometers travelling in circles seeking for a parking place.</p>\r\n\r\n<p> </p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Spend less money- </strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Obviously, if you drive more efficiently when looking for a parking spot, you will save gasoline. As a result, you will spend less money on gasoline. If you know your destination has a parking spot and you can book it in advance, it encourages a diver to drive a personal vehicle, rather than taking a cab service like Ola or Uber. Most of the time it works out cheaper.</p>\r\n\r\n<p> </p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Time is money-</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Furthermore, by travelling fewer kilometers in search of a parking spot, you will save important time that may be spent on work, recreation, or hobbies. As a result, you will spend less money on gasoline.          </p>\r\n\r\n<p> </p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Minimizing one&#39;s own environmental footprint-</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Another advantage of driving fewer kilometers to find a parking place is that you minimize individual pollution. Lower usage of all fossil fuels, gasoline, diesel, and the majority of alternative fuels emit emissions, particularly carbon dioxide (Co2). This pollutants will have no direct impact on human life. Co2 is, nevertheless, the most important contributor to greenhouse gases and, as a result, to climate change.</p>\r\n\r\n<p> </p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Increased security-</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Drivers are less distracted when looking for a parking spot because they know where they can park. They will be completely focused on the trip. By keeping their eyes on the road, they may reduce accidents and enhance safety for themselves, their own cars as well as other cars, and pedestrians.</p>\r\n\r\n<p> </p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Smart Parking eliminates the uncertainty of locating a parking place.</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>If you are not visiting a specific (region of a) city because you do not want to deal with the trouble of locating a parking place, ParkingAdda mobile app can help you with the same as you can choose and book an available spot in that location, up to 36 hours in advance. Knowing you&#39;ll be driving for a long time and will most likely end up somewhere far, far away from your destination might be disheartening.</p>\r\n\r\n<p> </p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Vehicle Safety-</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Smart parking with ParkingAdda will not guide you through a MAP exactly to your parking location, but also we have a dedicated representative at every spot for vehicle safety and additional guidance.</p>\r\n\r\n<p> </p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Smart parking will minimize the amount of time people spend looking for parking on the streets.</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Smart parking like ParkingAdda will ensure that there are fewer automobiles on the streets that drive slowly and circle for a long time seeking for a parking place. This will improve traffic flow and minimize congestion in communities with a lack of parking space. Clear authorized parking spots will also reduce two side road parking issues, which is very common in areas like Mumbai. Our roadways are now congested, making traffic management difficult, and to make matters worse, around 30% of the roads have been occupied with double parking, i.e. parking on both sides of the road. As a result, there are fewer traffic bottlenecks, and drivers benefit from reduced traffic on the roads.</p>\r\n\r\n<p> </p>\r\n\r\n<p> </p>\r\n\r\n<p>With a rise in the number of cars on the road and existing infrastructure difficulties, the demand for economies in mobility and parking becomes increasingly evident. Even if self-driving cars are becoming more common, the demand for parking does not appear to be reducing. At this point in time, cities must manage the possible effect of all future developments. This may be accomplished through accurate and future-proof design, as well as the use of a Smart Parking system to gather and analyze data, resulting in a healthier city.</p>\r\n\r\n<p> </p>\r\n\r\n<p> </p>\r\n\r\n<p> </p>\r\n\r\n<p>Also Read-            </p>\r\n\r\n<p> </p>\r\n\r\n<p>What are the benefits of renting your space to enhance smart parking?</p>\r\n\r\n<p> </p>\r\n\r\n<p>Do you reside in the city center, close to many companies, commuting routes, or maybe the local Marriage grounds or Sports stadium, etc.?

The major reasons or pain points of Vehicle driver and owners could be- lack of organized parking facilities or space, lack of parking guidance, etc. Even someone who has lived in Mumbai for a long time will find it difficult to obtain a suitable and secure parking space, as practically every Mumbaikar will attest with. Guess what, if you&#39;re new to a city like Mumbai, you’re most common and difficult struggle will be commuting owing to public transportation inconsistencies, massive traffic congestion, a lack of organized parking facilities, and expensive fines. Even worse, if your vehicle is towed, you&#39;ll have to figure out which tow site to contact, which will restart the vicious cycle from traffic to irregular public transport to fines and other procedures, etc.</p>\r\n\r\n<p> </p>\r\n\r\n<p> </p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>“Justice Kulkarni has addressed the subject of why unlawful parking is becoming a growing concern in terms of traffic management. In the same article, it was said that our highways are currently swamped with automobiles which makes traffic management difficult, and to top that about 30 percent of the roads have been filled by double parking, i.e. parking on both sides of the road. These are serious public concerns that must be addressed, and there is a need to develop long-term solutions so that we do not have a chaotic society.\" remarked Justice Kulkarni.”</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p> </p>\r\n\r\n<p>With ParkingAdda, one can save and plan their travel well by booking a parking spot online up to 36 hours in advance, instead of searching ‘Parking Near Me’ on the web - that doesn’t guarantee a spot, connecting with multiple friends and contacts to ask ‘Where can I find a safe/verified parking spot’ in a given location – which is time consuming. Surely, rather than doing what we do best, which is keeping an eye out for parking our cars and travelling from one area to the next, we want to discover parking spots quickly and easily, which is the USP of ‘ParkingAdda’.</p>\r\n\r\n<p> </p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>The main reason for traffic jams is unauthorized parking and solving parking issues will better traffic problems.</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Illegal on-street parking is one of the key causes of bad traffic congestion in major city centers. Inadequate and poorly managed parking facilities frequently force drivers to park illegally on the streets. When such parking encroachments spill onto footpaths, they endanger pedestrians&#39; lives as well. Even the broadest roadways become congested owing to unauthorized parking. On the other side, some roads have more traffic than they can handle. Thus, road expansion is a fairly ad hoc solution to the problem.</p>\r\n\r\n<p> </p>\r\n\r\n<p>Furthermore, with the lack of a centralized database, legislators and enforcers are uninformed about the traffic conditions and fail to take the necessary precautions to avoid traffic congestion. It&#39;s not difficult to picture that inadequate traffic management is the cause of traffic congestions. Even while local governments strive for forethought when planning and building a township, amenities such as paid parking are frequently overlooked. Furthermore, they may underestimate or act as if they have underestimated the vehicular density on specific roadways. Inadequate consideration of such critical elements contributes to traffic congestion in the long run.</p>\r\n\r\n<p> </p>\r\n\r\n<p> </p>\r\n\r\n<p>Solving traffic issues with smart parking the way forward and this is the reasons that make ParkingAdda a need based service in the country, which looks at organizing parking options.

When people complain that \"it&#39;s so difficult to find parking places these days\" or that they are caught in never-ending traffic jams, major part of the issue is irregular parking.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Parking places are becoming increasingly rare in India. We all want to find parking places quickly and easily, rather than having to keep an eye out of our cars and driving from one location to the next in the hopes of finding one. &#39;ParkingAdda&#39; is an online parking service that helps you locate a parking place easily online.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Car owner’s demand free or low-cost parking wherever they go, and any attempt to charge them a fee is met with derision, resulting in a rash of haphazard parking that not only obstructs pedestrian movement but also causes serious traffic congestion a significant waste of time and a serious public health issue given the harmful effects of vehicular pollution.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Parking has become a big challenge for commuters as the population and number of automobiles on the road has grown. While road extension, metro construction, and cab aggregators are being used to alleviate traffic congestion, the underlying problem of uncontrolled parking remains a serious concern.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>As a result, mobility as a service has emerged, which uses AI and IoT to record and anticipate mobility data. Smart online parking applications have integrated this new technology, allowing for more efficient parking management.</p>\r\n\r\n<p> </p>\r\n\r\n<p>In India&#39;s top eight cities, there are around 600K paid parking places distributed between residential, work, shopping, airports, railways, hospitals, and leisure. On-street, open air, floors of stores and offices, residential and work private property are all part of these examples of parking spaces.</p>\r\n\r\n<p> </p>\r\n\r\n<p>Here are a few brief statistics on current world challenges that will astound you:</p>\r\n\r\n<ul>\r\n <li>A Delhi commuter spends more than 80 hours a year looking for a parking spot, and the situation is similar in other metro areas like as Mumbai.</li>\r\n <li>Each year, drivers in the United States spend $20.4 billion and 44 hours looking for parking.</li>\r\n <li>Drivers in the United Kingdom spend $6.7 billion and spend 17 hours looking for parking.</li>\r\n <li>Every year, German drivers spend 4.4 billion euros and 44 hours looking for parking.</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n\r\n<p> </p>\r\n\r\n<p>The digital parking system from ParkingAdda uses real-time data, apps, and accurate sensors to show users which parking spaces are available and which are not. The idea is to cut down on time spent physically looking for a suitable parking lot, space, or even floor. Some systems may offer a comprehensive set of services, including parking time notifications, online payments, and even car-finding capabilities for larger parking lots. Both lot owners and customers can gain substantially from an automated parking system. The following are some of the most notable advantages:</p>\r\n\r\n<p> </p>\r\n\r\n<p>1. Parking optimization: Users can use the app to discover the best available parking spot, saving them time, effort, and money. The parking lot soon fills up, and businesses and commercial organizations can take advantage of the available space. Unauthorized parking and on-street parking can both be reduced.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>2. Improved Traffic Flow: As fewer cars are required to go about looking for an open parking spot, traffic flow improves. Automated legal online parking solutions will reduction in the number of on-street parked vehicles, which is the most important reason behind traffic congestions.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>3. Pollution Reduction: Looking for a parking spot uses far too much automobile oil, petrol, gasoline, diesel, CNG, and other fuels in a single day. An ideal parking solution will greatly reduce travel time while also reducing the amount of daily car exhaust and, as a result, India&#39;s and the world&#39;s pollution.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>4. Better User Experience: An online parking solution will bring together all components of the user experience into a single action. The destination arrival procedure easily integrates driver payment, location search, time notifications, and site identification.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>5. Additional Revenue Streams: Individuals, organizations, and other institutions can generate a passive income by renting out their premises.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>6. Simple Integrated Payments: The &#39;ParkingAdda&#39; application collects and distributes invoicing and payments. This could also help the organization maintain account transparency between customers and vendors.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>7. Increased Employment Costs: Several additional revenue sources is a potential with this smart parking system. For example, we would have parking lot representatives, which would increase employment in India during these times of job scarcity.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>8. Improved Car Security: Our spot representative and vehicle have real-time parking lot data, which may help avoid suspicious behavior and parking violations. Furthermore, if there was less spot-searching traffic on the highways, accidents caused by the obstruction of hunting for parking might be reduced. These parking guides will also facilitate parked vehicle safety, which is also a concern in India. Scratches, dents, tire inflations, etc. are a few common vehicle safety issues faced.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>9. Safety and Security of the Space: ParkingAdda does give Individuals, organizations, and other institutions an option to rent their spaces and earn additional income. Users can only utilize our parking places for registered vehicles, and our spot representative will be on site to recognize any suspicious conduct, parking offences, etc. and ensure space safety.</p>\r\n\r\n<p> </p>\r\n\r\n<p>As evidence of the aforementioned advantages, any organization or government would surely benefit from the usage of a digital online parking solution such as the &#39;ParkingAdda&#39;. Individuals are still unable to locate a parking space in some of the world&#39;s largest cities, where there are approximately four parking spaces per car. In India is said that the number of cars exceed the number of available parking spots. As the world&#39;s population grows and gets more sophisticated, it&#39;s more important than ever to put in place a user-friendly and well-planned parking system that can be used anywhere. In India, ParkingAdda is a need-based solution for the benefit of all citizens as well as the environment as a whole.</p>\r\n', 1, '19-10-22', '', 'parking'),

When there is no traffic, it is a lucky day; yet, if you are stuck in traffic, your entire day is spent agonizing or nagging over the same thing and the same reflects on your work. It does hamper your productivity. </p>\r\n\r\n<p>The same goes for when you&#39;re travelling for a family wedding or celebration, you&#39;re exhausted and frustrated by the time you arrive, and on top of that, people will come up to you and ask what took you so long! Isn&#39;t this incredibly relatable?</p>\r\n\r\n<p>In today’s day and time with the accuracy of maps and other IoT technologies traffic is something that gets accounted for or can be checked in advance before leaving for a destination. This means that even if you arrive at your business or other function on time or on schedule, you will normally waste more time parking your car because:</p>\r\n\r\n<ul>\r\n <li>you keep going around your parking lot looking for a parking space</li>\r\n <li>You may or may not be able to locate the parking manager.</li>\r\n <li>When you don&#39;t have enough change, you&#39;ll have to wait longer to pay with cash.</li>\r\n <li>There are some early movers who arrive before you and take your preferred parking spot.</li>\r\n <li>Parking is not allowed in the locality for outsiders</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n\r\n<p>Oh, that’s really tough to add to a work day, especially on a client meeting day (Lawyers, Chartered Accountants, etc. ParkingAdda has understood these difficulties are provider smart solutions to not only counter these solutions but also other problems like fuel wastage, vehicle safety, etc.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Time Saver-</strong> Additionally, by driving fewer kilometer’s in quest of a parking spot, you will save time that may be better spent on work, relaxation, or hobbies. You will save money on gasoline as a result.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Spend less money-</strong> It goes without saying that driving more efficiently while seeking for a parking spot will save you money on gas. You will save money on gasoline as a result. If you know your location has a parking spot and you can book it ahead of time, it encourages you to drive your own car instead of hiring an Ola or Uber cab.

Automobiles are a major cause of urban air pollution and are becoming a larger source of anthropogenic carbon dioxide and other greenhouse gases. The transportation industry is a key contributor, accounting for 90% of total emissions.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Air pollution is a severe threat to human health in the environment. Nausea, difficulty breathing, skin irritations, birth abnormalities, immunosuppression, and cancer are just a few of the side effects. All of these circumstances show that air pollution is becoming a serious issue in India, and that there is an urgent need to create a healthy atmosphere and raise the level of research globally. The current study examines the rise in vehicle pollution in India and its impact on human health as a result of increased road traffic.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>In major cities, the contribution of various sectors to ambient air quality mainly are domestic sector 8 %, industrial sector around 20 % and vehicular emission around 72 %.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>‘In India, there are an estimated 300 million automobiles’</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>&#39;There are an estimated 300 million automobiles in India.&#39;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Over the last five years, the number of tiny dangerous particles in Mumbai&#39;s automobile traffic has nearly doubled, making it the city&#39;s biggest contributor to the city&#39;s already poor air quality.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>According to a research conducted by the System of Air Quality Weather Forecasting and Research (SAFAR), the transportation sector accounted for 30.5 percent of PM 2.5 emissions in 2019-20, up to 16 percent in 2016-17.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>According to SAFAR, industry and power plants contributed 18 percent of PM2.5 emissions in 2019-20, down to 36 percent in 2016-17.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>In the same way, municipal garbage contributes 21.5 percent in 2019–20.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Solid waste plants, open burnings, crematoriums, the aviation sector, brick kilns, and other municipal waste contributors are among them.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Home burnings, which include residential cooking, emissions from street sellers, and wood burning, have decreased from 27% in 2016-17 to 15% in 2019-20.</p>\r\n\r\n<p> </p>\r\n\r\n<p>According to Dr. Gufran Beig source taken from TOI article, senior scientist and founder project director of SAFAR, the change was caused by a combination of increased vehicle traffic in Mumbai and more stalling at traffic signals, resulting in traffic congestion.</p>\r\n\r\n<p> </p>\r\n\r\n<p> </p>\r\n\r\n<p> </p>\r\n\r\n<p> </p>\r\n\r\n<p> </p>\r\n\r\n<p> </p>\r\n\r\n<p> </p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>A need based step taken by ParkingAdda to try and better the vehicle traffic </strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Online parking is one of the fastest growing and most widely used Smart City Solutions in the world. Universities, airports, public garages, and shopping malls are just a few of the businesses that have begun to reap the benefits of automated/smart parking technology through the usage of various Digital Parking applications. The ability to connect, analyze, and automate data collected from gadgets, referred to as and powered by the Internet of Things, has made this modern parking system possible.</p>\r\n\r\n<p> </p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>“4 wheeler density on the streets of Mumbai was around 12 lakhs in 2020, an overall surge of 30% in total number of vehicles is expected by 2025”. </strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p> </p>\r\n\r\n<p>In India, ‘ParkingAdda’ is one of the first movers in the market to introduce convenient online parking solutions, which any individual can reap benefits from. We have developed our own proprietary technology and have manufactured our sensors in-house, we are a ‘Make In India’ initiative. Our IOT-based smart parking management system enables parking operators to utilize parking resources more efficiently while also providing drivers with simplicity of use. Drivers can identify parking spots sooner with an effective parking management solution, which cuts fuel costs, saves time, and, most importantly, minimizes irritation. Because Parking Management solutions not only assists you to identify vacant spots faster, it also guides you to your exact parking spot through Maps. One of the stand-out USP of ParkingAdda is that every parking location will have representative you can contact after booking, for any additional guidance. Sensor installations and dedicated parking representatives gives a trust feeling of vehicle and space safety. Better and easy app usage increases authorized car park occupancy and also income to space renters.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The digital parking system from ParkingAdda uses real-time data, apps, and accurate sensors to show users which parking spaces are available and which are not. The idea is to cut down on time spent physically looking for a suitable parking lot, space, or even floor. Some systems may offer a comprehensive set of services, including parking time notifications, online payments, and even car-finding capabilities for larger parking lots. In terms of environment friendly issues we ParkingAdda provides the below solutions-</p>\r\n\r\n<p>1. Parking optimization: Users can use the app to discover the best available parking spot, saving them time, effort, and money. The parking lot soon fills up, and businesses and commercial organizations can take advantage of the available space. Unauthorized parking and on-street parking can both be reduced.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>2. Improved Traffic Flow: As fewer cars are required to go about looking for an open parking spot and roadside parking can be reduced, traffic flow improves.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>3. Pollution reduction: Looking for a parking spot uses far too much automobile oil, gasoline, diesel, CNG, and other fuels in a single day. An ideal parking solution will greatly reduce travel time while also reducing the amount of daily car exhaust and, as a result, India&#39;s and the world&#39;s pollution levels.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>4. Simple Integrated and Paperless Payments: The &#39;ParkingAdda&#39; application collects and distributes invoicing and payments. This reduces use of paper challans and receipts and also helps the organization maintain account transparency between customers and vendors.</p>\r\n\r\n<p> </p>\r\n\r\n<p>For Detailed Features Also Read-</p>\r\n\r\n<p>How Drivers Will Benefit from Smart Parking</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Rent your Parking Space to Smart Parking Solutions</p>\r\n\r\n<p> </p>\r\n\r\n<p>As evidence of the aforementioned advantages, any organization or government would surely benefit from the usage of a digital parking solution such as the &#39;ParkingAdda&#39; Digital Parking app. Individuals are still unable to locate a parking space in some of the world&#39;s largest cities, where there are approximately four parking spaces per car. As the world&#39;s population grows and gets more sophisticated, it&#39;s more important than ever to put in place a user-friendly and well-planned parking system that can be used anywhere.

Every year, tens of thousands of accidents occur in parking lots and garages, resulting in around hundreds of deaths and thousands of injuries. Parking lots become even more perilous around the holidays.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Parking lots are made for automobiles, not pedestrians. Parking lots should be treated as roadways and crossroads, complete with speed restrictions, traffic markings, and traffic patterns.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>According to auto insurance, the number of claims spikes on Black Friday Sales and continues to be higher than usual throughout the holiday shopping season. Many fender-benders go unreported, therefore the number of events is likely larger than insurance claims imply.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>A few common vehicle parking issues are due to no proper parking guide, driving through different streets / levels of parking lots in search of parking, tire inflation, other vehicles park close to your vehicle obstructing movements, identifying your car park at the time of moving out results in time wastage, etc. Indians face a tough time driving especially in metro cities due to traffic & parking issues. The major reasons for the same is, ‘number of vehicles has out beaten the number of parking spaces’, due to these a lot of car owners park illegally on streets or any other place that they find vacant. By parking illegally the consequences are to be bared not only by the other citizen including road officials but also by the same person who has parked illegally (toeing vans, other damages and expenses). The only gainer is the Government who generates income in terms ‘challans’, etc. These are a common phenomenon in countries like India and in order to address these issues ‘ParkingAdda’ online parking app has tried to find a few parking solutions.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Addressing the Indian market ParkingAdda has introduced a parking guide as a part of their service, who will be available 24x7, to guide the car owner as well as assure vehicle safety. So for example- When you book a parking spot online through the ParkingAdda android parking app or the IOS parking app, the map will guide you to your booked parking spot and also in case of any connectivity issues or other issues, have an option to call the ParkingAdda parking guide to get directions, he will be available at the spot and help you park safely and securely.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Here are a few simple safety guidelines to help you stay safe while getting in and out of your car,  with ParkingAdda’s guide a lot of these will be taken off & will help you park stress-free -</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Driver Safety</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<ul>\r\n <li>Always keep track of where you parked, you’ll not have a ParkingAdda map or call guide.</li>\r\n <li>Avoid parking near shrubs or vans with slide-open doors on the side.
